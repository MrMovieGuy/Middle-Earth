	<h4>Hugo Weaving has no plans to return as Elrond for upcoming Lord of the Rings film. (Jones, 2024)</h4>
	<p>Hugo Weaving has recently stated that he had been fed up of the Lord of the Rings francise as he told GamesRadar+,<br>"It was great being in New Zealand on and off for a 10-year period."<br>"I did go back and work with the same team on a project called Mortal Engines, which was going to be their next big franchise, but it died on its arse. So, I've had enough of Middle-earth. I don't imagine anyone would ask me to do it again." (Stolworthy, 2024).</p>
